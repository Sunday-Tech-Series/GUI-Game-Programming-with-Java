## General info

The graphical user interface (GUI) is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation.

- _Output of a code in text-based user interfaces v/s same in graphical user interface._

In this webinar we are going to learn the basic components of GUI and how to code them using Java Programming language. At the end of session we are going to use our learnings and make a small GUI game project.

## Installation of JDK and Eclipse IDE

- **Java Development Kit** (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development.
- **Eclipse** is an open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE) supported by IBM. The Eclipse platform can be used to develop rich client applications, integrated development environments and other tools. It is popular for Java application development and Android apps, but can be used as an IDE for any programming language for which a plug-in is available. Eclipse is cross-platform and runs under Windows, Linux and macOS. 364 companies reportedly use Eclipse in their tech stacks, including Accenture, ViaVarejo, and Zalando.  
We are going to use them to devlop our GUI game.
